This is a simple task logging app that requires the user to enter date, client name, task name and time as an input. the app saves these information for further processing such as pivoting and analysing the work. although at this point (04022021) only logging part of the app is complete.

the app is built with react.js node.js-express and mongoDB. 

you can clone the repository and install the dependencies and the app will run locally provided that you already have mongoDB community installed on your local machine.
